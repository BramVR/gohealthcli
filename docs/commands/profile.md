description: "Archive a Profile Snapshot from the provider."
---

Fetch the upstream profile blob (units, time zone, demographic settings as exposed by the Google Health API) and append it to the Health Archive as a new Profile Snapshot. Each invocation creates a new dated snapshot rather than overwriting the prior one, so historical settings drift is preserved.

A Profile Snapshot is not a Data Point. It is metadata about the consenting user's account and the unit conventions in force at the time of fetch.
